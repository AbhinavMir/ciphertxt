This website (ciphertxt.xyz) is an MIT licensed, open sourced project that aims to transfer my notes on cryptography and related fields using Nextra. I am not accepting posts, however, I will accept improvements and suggestions to the website. If you want to contribute, please visit the issues tab and open an issue! I will try to respond as soon as possible. Commercialisation of the project is permitted, however, I would like to be credited for the original work and would like to be informed about the commercialisation so we can discuss a fair compensation. You can use this in a classroom-setting as long as you credit me and do not charge the students for the notes. I would also love it if you could send me a link to the course so I can see how you're using it!
