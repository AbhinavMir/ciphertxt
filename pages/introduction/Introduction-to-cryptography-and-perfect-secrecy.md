### What is perfect secrecy?

Let $(Gen, Enc, Dec)$ be an encryption scheme with message space $M$ and ciphertext space $C$. For $m, m' \in M$ and $c\in C$, the following holds true. 
$$
\Pr[Enc_k(m) = c] = \Pr[Enc_k(m') = c] \text{ (1)}
$$$

In this, $Pr$ refers to probability. If this, if $(1)$ holds true, then the probability of a ciphertext $c$ being generated by encrypting $m$ is the same as the probability of $c$ being generated by encrypting $m'$. This is the definition of perfect secrecy.
