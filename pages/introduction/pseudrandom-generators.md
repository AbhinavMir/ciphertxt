A fundamental tool used to achieve computational security is the pseudorandom generator (PRG). Pseudorandom generators are algorithms that generate sequences of bits that appear to be random but are, in fact, deterministically derived from a shorter random seed. These generators act as a crucial component in many cryptographic constructions, allowing us to produce longer, seemingly random streams of data from a shorter, truly random seed.

Why PRGs and not true randomness? It's for practicality purpose. PRGs provide true 

```python
import random

# Generate a random float between 0 and 1
random_float = random.random()
print(random_float)
```

The security of pseudorandom generators relies on the assumption that the output they produce is indistinguishable from true randomness, even for computationally bounded adversaries. If a PRG meets this property, it is considered cryptographically secure. However, designing provably secure pseudorandom generators is a non-trivial task, as it requires rigorous mathematical proofs and the ability to withstand sophisticated attacks.

With a secure pseudorandom generator, it becomes possible to use a shorter, random seed to produce a long stream of bits that can be used as a key for encryption. This overcomes the key length limitations of one-time pads and enables the use of symmetric encryption schemes with strong computational security guarantees.

One widely used application of pseudorandom generators is in stream ciphers, where the key stream generated by the PRG is combined with the plaintext using a bitwise XOR operation to produce the ciphertext. Stream ciphers are efficient and well-suited for secure communication in scenarios where data is transmitted in a continuous flow, such as real-time communication or data streaming.

In conclusion, computational security and the use of pseudorandom generators have become essential in modern cryptography, where we prioritize practicality and efficiency while still providing strong security guarantees against adversaries with realistic computational capabilities. By embracing these principles, cryptographers can create encryption schemes that strike a balance between security and efficiency, making secure communication and data protection viable in a wide range of applications.
