### Analogy

Imagine a garden with flowers planted in a regular, repeating pattern. The lattice represents the way these flowers are arranged, forming a grid-like structure throughout the garden. However, the lattice does not have to follow the direction of the garden's slope; it can have its own orientation and spacing.

Now, consider a smaller section of the garden that contains a representative sample of the flower pattern. This smaller section can be a unique and self-contained shape, like a flowerbed or a specific arrangement of flowers. This smaller section represents the fundamental domain.

The fundamental domain is not restricted to align with the lattice's basis vectors. It can have its own orientation and shape within the larger garden, as long as it captures the essence of the lattice's repeating pattern. When you replicate and translate this fundamental domain through the lattice (like shifting and copying the flowerbed across the garden), it will cover the entire garden without leaving any gaps or overlaps.
