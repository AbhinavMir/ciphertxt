I would also like to thank ChatGPT because some of my notes were cumbersome and needed a lot of context which ChatGPT is great at providing. At some points, I had to use ChatGPT because I couldn't figure out a way to put my concepts into words properly and I didn't want to be handwavey, or needed to sanity check some concepts and while it does hallucinate a lot, it can provide a good general direction. ChatGPT is a great tool, I recommend using it for learning things. Please note that I absolutely have concerns over IP rights, x-risk and such w.r.t to LLMs. I personally pay for it, but you can run many solid models locally!

*Another Note*: There are way more acknowledgements, and I will add them slowly!
